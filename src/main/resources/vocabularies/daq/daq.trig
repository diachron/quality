# VOCABULARY
daq:

        rdfs:label "Dataset Quality Vocabulary (daQ)" ;
        rdfs:comment "The Dataset Quality Vocabulary (daQ) is a lightweight, extensible core vocabulary for attaching the result of quality benchmarking of a linked open dataset (usually an expensive process) to that dataset.  daQ is designed to be extended by custom quality metrics.  Use cases include filtering and ranking datasets by quality." ;

# CLASSES
daq:QualityGraph
	a	rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;

	rdfs:comment	"Defines a quality graph which will contain all metadata about quality metrics on the dataset." ;

# Abstract Classes
daq:Category
	a	rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;
	rdfs:comment	"The highest level of quality metric is a category. A category groups a number of dimensions relevant to each other which aims at measuring the quality of a dataset from different aspects. Categories are provided as subclasses of this abstract class, which is not intended for direct usage." ;
	rdfs:label	"Category" .
	
daq:Dimension
	a	rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;
	rdfs:comment	"Each dimension is part of a larger group called category (See daq:Category). Each dimension has a number of metrics which are associated to it. A dimension is linked with a category using the daq:hasDimension property. Dimensions are provided as subclasses of this abstract class, which is not intended for direct usage." ;
	rdfs:label	"Dimension" .
	
daq:Metric
	a	rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;
	rdfs:comment	"The smallest unit of measuring a quality dimension is a metric. Each metric have a value which is associated to the quality computed. Since this value is multi-typed (i.e. one metric might return true/false whilst another might require a double value), then the value's (daq:hasValue) range is inherited by the metric's attributes. A metric might also require additional information (e.g. a gold standard dataset to compare with). Therefore, a concrete metric representation shall also define such properties (see daq:requires). Metrics are provided as subclasses of this abstract class, which is not intended for direct usage." ;

	rdfs:comment	"Quality metrics can be (in principle) calculated on various forms of data (such as datasets, graphs, set of triples etc...). This vocabulary allow the owner/user of such RDF data to create multiple quality graphs and identify the corresponding dataset resource (e.g. the dataset URI) for the quality graph." ;

# Abstract Properties
daq:hasDimension

	rdfs:label	"hasDimension" ;
	rdfs:comment	"The category concept classifies dimensions related to the measurement of quality for a specific criteria. This is an abstract property and should not be used directly. Specific sub-properties should be inherited for different dimensions." ;

daq:hasMetric
	a	rdf:Property, owl:ObjectProperty ;
	rdfs:label	"hasMetric" ;
	rdfs:comment	"A dimension is an abstract concept which groups an number of more concrete metrics to measure quality of a dataset. This is an abstract property and should not be used directly. Specific sub-properties should be inherited for different metrics." ;

daq:value
	a	rdf:Property, owl:DatatypeProperty ;
	rdfs:label	"value" ;
	rdfs:comment	"Each metric will have a value computed. In order to deal with the different return type of the metric computation, this generic (abstract) property links a metric with a value object (e.g. boolean, double, Literal). This property should not be used directly." ;

daq:requires
	a	rdf:Property, owl:ObjectProperty ;
	rdfs:label	"requires" ;
	rdfs:comment	"A metric might require a number of external resources (e.g. a gold standard) in order to be able to measure the quality. In order to cater for the most generic requirement, this abstract property links a metric to the required resource. This property should not be used directly." ;
